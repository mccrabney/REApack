the select/copy scripts will operate most predictably using these MIDI editor settings:

-- One MIDI editor per track/project
-- Open all MIDI in the track/project
-- media item selection is linked to visibility OFF
-- selection is linked to editability OFF
-- Make secondary items editable by default
