mccrabney scripts - MIDI editing from the main screen, inspired by grid-editing in JJOS 128XL, a third party OS for the MPC1000/2500 sequencers.

the goal of these scripts is to spend less time in the MIDI editor.

start with "mccrabney_MIDI edit - show notes, under mouse and last-received" 
this will give a readout of notes under the mouse cursor in Arrange, including the last MIDI note currently received by your controller.

the select/copy scripts will operate most predictably using these MIDI editor settings:

-- One MIDI editor per track/project
-- Open all MIDI in the track/project
-- media item selection is linked to visibility OFF
-- selection is linked to editability OFF
-- Make secondary items editable by default
