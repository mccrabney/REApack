welcome to mccrabney's repo

here you will find some scripts that i have created to fulfill some needs i had in REAPER.

the focus right now is to provide arrange-screen MIDI editing via Razer Edits. an older focus: keyboard control for razer edits.

note that quickly retriggering scripts that move cursor/RE forwards/backwards will trigger the [ReaScript task control "Script name" is running in the background] message.
for each action, select "new instance" and "remember choice" 
this will retrigger the script and it should behave as expected when hammering a directional key.
