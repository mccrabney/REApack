welcome to mccrabney's repo - - 

here you will find some scripts that i have created to fulfill some MIDI editing needs i had in REAPER.

the Razor Edit-MIDI editing scripts are meant to be run from the main screen, and can work on multiple items/REs.
they are inspired by grid-editing in JJOS 128XL, a third party OS for the MPC1000/2500 sequencers.

the goal is to spend less time in the MIDI editor, so that users can delete/nudge MIDI from the main screen,
using their MIDI hardware to dictate which notes are deleted by means of monitoring the "last note hit."
    for example, delete the last note hit from a set of RE selections, 
    or delete notes higher/lower and equal to the last hit note - or the note under the mouse cursor.
    
multiple notes in multiple items can be enclosed in REs and copied/pasted directly from the main screen.
REs can also be used to select MIDI notes (must enclose notes' NoteOns) for deeper editing in the MIDI editor.

the select/copy scripts will operate most predictably using these MIDI editor settings:

 -- One MIDI editor per track/project

-- Open all MIDI in the track/project

-- media item selection is linked to visibility OFF

-- selection is linked to editability OFF

-- Make secondary items editable by default
